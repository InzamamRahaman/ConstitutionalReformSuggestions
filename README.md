# ConstitutionalReformSuggestions
Suggestions to be sent to the advisory board regarding upcoming constitutional reforms for the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago

My recommendations are underpinned by six distinct principles: 
1. Recognizing the computational nature of many systems, it's critical to ensure the quality of inputs, as flawed inputs lead to flawed outputs. It's equally important to evaluate these systems' error-correction capabilities and their efficiency in yielding desirable outcomes.
2. Social structures should be intentionally designed to reward positive behaviors and penalize negative ones.
3. Systems must be designed for resilience, striving for antifragility over mere robustness.
4. Decision-makers and representatives of the public should have a vested interest in the outcomes of their decisions. They should have "skin in the game".
5. Information tends to be distributed and often loses its integrity when centralized entities try to consolidate it.
6. Problem-solving over non-trivial domains benefits from collaborative rather than combative attitudes. Social systems should encourage the former and mitigate the latter.
